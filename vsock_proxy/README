vsock proxy
===========

Mostly a complete copy from https://github.com/marlinprotocol/oyster-monorepo/tree/master/networking/raw-proxy
with some logging and with some primitive NAT
for outgoing packets - replacing source IP with
host's address, since NFQUEUE returns original packets
not the NATed version, and Rust lib used doesn't
let us read the NAT info. Also using TUN device to
insert incoming packets to kernel for reverse-NAT.
